            <p>Whenever you want to achieve something, keep your eyes open, concentrate and make sure you know exactly
                what it is you want. No one can hit their target with their eyes closed. If you stay focused and right
                on track, you will get to where you want to be.</p>

            <p>The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that human
                beings can understand them clearly. A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional
                aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm
                works and to convince a reader that the results will be correct.</p>
